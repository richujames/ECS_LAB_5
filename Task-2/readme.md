Task-2: 
I. What is little- and big-endian means?
    • Little-endian: The least significant byte is stored first.
    • Big-endian: The most significant byte is stored first.
II. List at least 5 common CPU architectures:
    • x86
    • x86_64 (AMD64)
    • ARM
    • MIPS
    • PowerPC
III. What is the file system used in Android, Linux, Windows, and Mac?
    • Android: ext4 (with variations)
    • Linux: ext4 (with variations)
    • Windows: NTFS (New Technology File System)
    • Mac: HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus) and APFS (Apple File System)
IV. List at least the names of 10 filesystems:
    • ext4
    • NTFS
    • FAT32
    • HFS+
    • APFS
    • exFAT
    • XFS
    • Btrfs
    • ZFS
    • ReFS
V. What is the purpose of each directory inside the root folder /?
    • /bin: Essential command binaries
    • /boot: Static files of the boot loader
    • /dev: Device files
    • /etc: Host-specific system configuration
    • /home: User home directories
    • /lib: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
    • /mnt: Mount point for mounting filesystems temporarily
    • /opt: Add-on application software packages
    • /proc: Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information
    • /sbin: Essential system binaries
    • /tmp: Temporary files
    • /usr: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data
    • /var: Variable data, such as logs and spool files
VI. What is the difference between GPT and MBR?
    • GPT (GUID Partition Table) supports more partitions (up to 128), larger partition sizes (up to 9.4 ZB), and provides better data redundancy and error correction.
    • MBR (Master Boot Record) is limited to 4 primary partitions or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition, with a maximum size of 2 TB. It's an older and less flexible partitioning scheme compared to GPT.
